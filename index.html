                <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
                <p>I am known for being a hard worker when it comes down to the basics and a mood booster for people
                    that work around me. I have left working in warehouses to pursuit something that is more challenging
                    and will benefit the future. I am willing to learn anything that will apply to that and wanting to
                    find a company to work with for decades. </p>
